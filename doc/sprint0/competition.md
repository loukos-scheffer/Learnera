## How is your product different?

Our virtual platform offers a combination of features of the above products.   
While the above products are good at what they do individually, they do not   
provide integration between all products. Our product is different from the above  
products as it provides deep integration between different products.


## Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios? 

A local business owner with one location wants to expand their business but does  
not have the technical knowledge and does not have the means to acquire such knowledge.  
Our product puts all knowledge required in one place. There is no need for a busy  
business owner to do additional research as our product streamlines the process of  
expanding their business by educating users, connecting users with investors or   
institutions, and making a platform where the user can organize/plan future steps.

## Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?

All of the above products are for-profit products and there is very little to   
make from small business owners. The users for our product are small business   
owners who may not have enough money for high monthly/yearly fee services. 

The above products may be interested in making a product similar to ours but   
without a scaling user base it will be hard to make profits. At the same time a   
scaling user base erodes a sense of community and locality that our product strives for.
