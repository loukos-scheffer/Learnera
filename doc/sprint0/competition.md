## How is your product different?

Our virtual platform offers a combination of features of the above products. While the above products are good at what they do individually, they do not provide a good integration between community and E-learning platforms. Our product is different from the above products as it provides a focus on both community and E-learning.


## Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios? 

A local business owner with one location wants to expand their business but does not have the technical knowledge and does not have the means to acquire such knowledge. Our product puts all knowledge required in one place. There is no need for a busy business owner to do additional research as our product streamlines the process of expanding their business by educating users, connecting users with investors or institutions, and making a platform where the user can organize/plan future steps.

## Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?

All of the above products focus to much on connecting people around the world while our product is more concerned with creating a tight knit community. The users for our product are small business owners who may not have enough money for high monthly/yearly fee services.

Our goal is to build profesional relationships that will benefit everyone while our competitors are more focused on numbers rather than the benefit of the general 
user.
