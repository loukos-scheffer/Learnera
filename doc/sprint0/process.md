# Team structure

Our team exercises an agile devepopment strategy and each member, works in a programming/software development role. As a developer our team works to implement features for the MVP.

The team has also reserved the right to appoint a member as a tester to ensure product quality.

# Organization

To keep things organized, the team uses a git repository hosted on GitHub and follows proper gitflows. The team also uses Jira to keep track of stories and keep track of the state of completion of the product.

# Decision making

Decision making in our team is done by conducting a majority vote. 

# Meeting

1-3 hour mandatory meetings within our team are conducted weekly on Wednesdays, with additional meetings scheduled as needed. Attendance of these additional meetings is not required.

# Reflection and the next phase

During sprint 0, the team worked well together to establish our goal. During meetings, meeting minutes were recorded and we kept an organized section of what is remaining to do for future meetings.

For the next phase of the project, we will continue following the organization, and work stategies we have already been using. We are looking to also explore new strategies to divide work.
