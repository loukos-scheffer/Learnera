# Sprint retrospective
## 2021-07-16

### The participants in the meeting 
* Everyone was there, Karampreet, Tian, Jack, Haiyang, Josh, Louis, Nick
### Unfinished tasks and group them into stories
* This sprint we were able to complete every ticket we dedicated ourselves to.   
There are no unfinished tasks.
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
* For the next sprint we will continue practicing what we have been for the past  
3 sprints, this includes leveraging team mates, and reading documentation.
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
* As we are working on integrating zoom conferences this sprint, we find our practice  
to read documentation and ask others for help to be very important this sprint.
### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
* When stuck trying to implement something, and not leveraging resources such as   
documentation, team members, online posts.
### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3

## Best:
* The feeling of accomplishment as assigned tasks were being completed and seeing  
the result in the form of a burndown chart.
* Figuring out how to implement error states of fields throughout the website.   
It was satisfying to have learned how to use them, and to implement them.
* Doing the demo in front of the TA and actually being proud of our work.
* It was really nice to see each othersâ€™ assigned features being completed as the  
sprint went on, an example is when the comments apis/client work, and viewing e-learning  
videos client work.

## Worst:
* To see some work we had done, not being able to be leveraged in several areas   
of the website. One example is the like button not having been able to be implemented  
within comments.
* When CSS and HTML were being problematic. 
* Having some features break due to minor bugs, and having to figure them out before  
the demo.
* Trying to implement features while having to do several assignments from other courses.
